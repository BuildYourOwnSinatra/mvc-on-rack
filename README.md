# Weather Tasks

A demo app built for my book Build Your Own Sinatra. It's built directly on Rack without any framework.

It is a todo app for weather. Want to plan out what we you are going to do when it rains? Use WeatherTasks. Sure, it sounds purely useless, but you know you want another weather app.

## Installation and Usage

Clone it and then run:

```sh
$ bundle install
```

Boot it up with:

```sh
$ bundle exec rspec
```

To run tests use:

```sh
$ bundle exec rspec
```

## Following Along With The Book

Step Branches correspond to sections of the ["MVC on Rack" chapter](https://github.com/BuildYourOwnSinatra/BuildYourOwnSinatra/blob/master/source/chapters/05_MVC.html.md.erb). To follow along with the book checkout the relavent branch for the section:

```sh
git checkout step-1
```

## Contributions

*Note*: The repo is designed to follow the contents of the book; for most contributions you will want to make a pull request on the book's [repo](https://github.com/BuildYourOwnSinatra/BuildYourOwnSinatra) first.

1. Fork. it
2. Create. a new branch (git checkout -b cat-evolver)
3. Commit. your changes (git commit -am 'Add Cat Evolution')
4. Test. your changes (always be testing) (you can skip this step for content changes)
5. Push. to the branch (git push origin cat-evolver)
6. Pull. Request. (for extra points include funny gif and or pun in comments)

To remember this you can use the easy to remember and totally not tongue-in-check initialism:
FCCTPP.

I don't want any of these steps to scare you off. If you don't know how to do something or are struggle getting it to work feel free to create a pull request or issue anyway. I'll be happy to help you get your contributions up to code and into the repo!

*Note*: This is a demo/learning app so no feature requests please. We all want advanced weather apps to be built but with all my TODO apps I simply don't have the time.
